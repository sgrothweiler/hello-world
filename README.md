# hello-world

Name: Steven Rothweiler
Goal: Learn as many web development technologies as I need, to help build a parent volunteer (and more) system for my daughter's school.
Education/Companies: BSEE from Rutgers 1985, MSEE from Cornell 1987, Bell Labs, NEC Labs, Startups, Agere/LSI, Payroll Tax Filing.
Background Technologies: Raised on UNIX/C, now into C++, Java, Visual Studio, etc.

Questions:
1. So GitHub is based on the command-line git, which I can get from my favorite command-line supplier on Windows, Cygwin, but will it work for cloning and pulling GitHub repositories on Windows?
